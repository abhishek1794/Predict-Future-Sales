# Predict-Future-Sales
It was a regression problem to predict the total sales for every product and stores in the next month. The time series dataset had more than 3 M entries of around 22 thousand items divided into 84 categories from 60 shops for a period of 34 months. Feature Engineering was extensively applied to get more insights from the data. Built regression models (XGBoost and RF) to predict the sales.  We were able to get the sales of each item in the next month for every shop. The accuracy further increased when we were able to identify the feature with more Information Value (Price Trend).  Key skills: Python, Feature Engineering, XGboost, Random Forest
